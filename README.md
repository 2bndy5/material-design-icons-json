[![Pack Icons into JSON](https://github.com/2bndy5/material-design-icons-json/actions/workflows/package.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/2bndy5/material-design-icons-json/actions/workflows/package.yaml)

## What

A python script to aggregate the
[Material Design Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/) (v4.0.0+)
from SVG sources into several compiled JSON files. Each JSON file will have all the
icons available for a specific style (`regular`, `round`, `sharp`, `outlined`,
`twotone`).

## Why

This tool exists to serve updates for
[the sphinx-design extension](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-design)
which incorporates the resulting json files into new reStructuredText roles.

## Attribution
